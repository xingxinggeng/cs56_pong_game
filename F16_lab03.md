a) This repo is a recreation of the game pong where players control a block and try to hit a ball past their opponent.

b) 
   * As a player I can move the block so that I can redirect the ball back. 
   * As a player I can change the difficulty so that I can have a greater challenge and more fun.
   * As a player I can play with a friend so that I can have fun with another person.
   * As a player I can save my highscore so that I can challenge my friends and gain bragging rights.

c) The software does run and the game plays. The difficulty setting doesn't seem to do anything except change the window size and when the ball is hit, it never changes speed.

d) 
   * As a player who wants to play alone, I can play against an AI, so that I don't need another person to enjoy pong. 
   * As a player I want to be able to move the block at varying speeds which affects ball travel time, so that the games become more challenging and fun.    
   * As a difficulty setting, there should be obstacles in the middle that can reflect a ball back, so that there is more variance in play and thus a greater challenge.
   * As a player who wants different gameplay, I want to be able to hold on to the ball, so that I can control where the ball returns and win the game.
   * As a player who enjoys randomness, I want there to be powerups, so that games become more interesting.

e) The current quality of the readme file is pretty good. There is a class diagram which clearly shows how each class is connected to one another. There are specifications on how to run the program and such and a nice description on what the game is. 

f) The build.xml is working correctly as the program ruins without issues. The build compiles and runs correctly. It has create javadoc as an option, but it isn't listed under ant -p. 

g) There are plenty of issues for us to work on and most of them are pretty clear as to what they expect. A lot of the "issues" are actually just improvements to the game such as adding an AI. That alone could net us up to 700 points. 

h) 1. Changing ball speed [#59] (https://github.com/UCSB-CS56-Projects/cs56-games-pong/issues/59)
   

i) The code itself looks fine. Classes and their functions are all commented well with descriptions on what the class is suppose to do as a whole and how it goes about doing it. There doesn't seem to be any getter functions which means that encapsulation isn't present. Protecting the variables would probably be a good idea. How each class relates to each other is quite obvious due to the way its organized so no issues there. There seems to be very little JUnit tests at all. There are only tests for the constructors at the moment.

j) The test coverage is very low. There are Junit tests but they are very sparse many of the tests are commented out. There are a bunch of opportunities to expand test coverage by fixing the commented out constructor tests and adding more tests for other methods.
