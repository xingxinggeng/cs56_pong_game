## Andrew Polk, Victoria Sneddon

## (A)
The project is a simple game of pong. In the game each player has a paddle and they hit a ball between them. If you let the ball get past you then you lose a life or the game.

## (B)
As a user I can open the game program so that I can select play. Then I can select the difficulty and have two players compete. As a user I can control the paddle and can hold the ball using the keyboard. As a user you also have the option to return to main menu and look at the instructions.

## (C)
The software runs, although there are some noticable issues. The software allows you to Look at instructions, Start a new game or exit. When you start a new game You choose your difficulty level and enter the game. In the game each player controls a paddle and tries to keep a ball from moving past them. The players can also hold the ball, pause the game, exit to the menu, and quit the game.

## (D)
As a user I would like to be able to choose the colors of the ball and the paddles, rather than the current flashing colors.
As a user I would also like the paddles and the ball to move smoother.
As a user I believe it would be nice to have sound effects and maybe background music.
As a user I would like there to be an option to play an AI Opponent who is defeatable.

## (E)
The readme could be made easier to read by dividing it up into sections for todo or features already implemented. Currently it is divided by the quarter that is was worked on making it hard to read.

## (F)
The build.xml file could be cleaned up to fix the fomating making it easier to read. It also needs some desciptions added to targets.

## (G)
The issues listed are not fullly comprehensive. Some we will fix, but there are other issues outside of those listed that we intend on fixing. There are definitely enough issues to earn us 1000 points considering all of the possibilities that this game could have. The issues are pretty clear about their expectations.

## (I)
The code is fairly well organized. The classes have names that are self-explanatory for the most part. In addition, there are lots of comments detailing the functions of each method. It is kind of hard to see how the classes are related, so you have to guess about what's being looked for when a class is called. Also some variables are never used. If someone were to take an overlook at a section of the code, I would show them the classes and where the methods they obtain are implemented.

## (J)
There are limited tests included but the tests that are included are mostly commented out. There are no comments that say why the tests are commented out or if they would still work and be useful. There are a lot of opportunities to expand test coverage even by just reimplementing the commented out testing that are already in the test files.
