First Impressions:
This is a game called Pong. To play the game, the players pick a game mode from the main menu then press the spacebar to begin the game. The moves from side to side across the screen. The players must control their paddle and prevent the ball from hitting their side of the screen. When one person allows the ball to hit their end, they lose a life. Once a player loses three lives, the game is over and the other player wins. The game and its interface work and look good. 

Issues on GitHub:
There are 5 issues on GitHub for this game. They are: adding Junit tests, changing comments to Javadoc format, fix the labels in the diagram in the README.md file, adding a pause game functionality, and adding an extreme mode. 

Observations:
The code compiles and runs smoothly. The game works fine. All of the ant targets work well and do what they are supposed to. 

Plans:
We plan on:

-Refactoring comments into javadoc style comments 
-Fixing the labels the the class diagram
-Adding the ability to pause the game and return to the main menu from the pause menu
-Adding different Extreme modes that each do unique things
